Christiane Gautrot was an interior designer, Desmond Knox-Leet, a painter, and Yves Coueslant, a theater director and set designer. The first two collaborated designing fabrics and wallpaper for Liberty and Sanderson. 

They were joined by the third in 1961 and opened a shop to display their designs. Yves became the administrator and consultant; Desmond and Christiane were the artistic soul. Bit by bit, with finely honed taste, the trio transformed the site into a one-of-a-kind setting, a kind of stylish bazaar where one found surprising articles unmatched in Paris, mined and conveyed home by the trio over the course of their travels.

This jacket was like the “flight” jackets worn by American Air Force pilots in the 50s, imitating the same attractive, comfortable, and solid style. But this jacket would bear the name of a Frenchman, Charles Chevignon.

Born in 1979 from the talent of a man who dreamed of America, Chevignon, a teenage icon and a reference in Street Culture, has evolved ever since, keeping up with the times while capitalising on its DNA.

The inventor of aged leather and the benchmark in the world of leather jackets, Chevignon revisits its iconic pieces with every season: flight jackets, bomber jackets, teddys, down jackets... letting its creativity soar when it comes to the male wardrobe.

A rare bird, Chevignon conceives and designs beautiful clothes in France that are made to last, with the motto: “what is beautiful stays beautiful”.

The CHEVIGNON man, at ease in his era, combines appearance and casualness. A style which has always been unique, the rallying cry of the groups who see the city as their playground.

Driven by the shared desire to make elevated yet wearable pieces for the everyday, we strive to bring more than a boutique shopping experience to you but to use DÔEN to connect with our customers, build an open community, and foster relationships with the inspiring individuals who wear our clothes throughout their lives. As a women-owned company, a cornerstone of the DÔEN brand mission is supporting women in the workplace and in the supply chain.

We are intentional when selecting our manufacturers, partnering only with factories that share our values. We are proud that our production partners share our commitment to supporting those who identify as women in the workplace and are collaborators in our mission to eliminate the gender gap at every point in the supply chain. We have chosen to work with women-owned or co-owned manufacturers: Currently, 50% of our apparel factories are owned by women, and the other 50% are co-owned.

We believe that today’s sustainability conversations, which have been centered around environmental impact, are crucial - but are interconnected to environmental, economic, racial, and social justice. We work with 3rd-party compliance audits and certifications to evaluate our manufacturing partners on a host of practices, from gender and social equality to wages to ethical work environments. In making a decision to work with a specific facility, we look for several indicators - including the people in management roles that identify as women, the factory’s control of all stages of production, the presence of internal worker’s unions, and any established foundations/organizations that directly benefit their employees and/or the surrounding community.

Our team knows their stuff. They’re confident and creative and unafraid to challenge convention to find solutions, taking accountability for their actions, but always with kindness and humility. 
  
Our promise is to do our bit to make living a joyful experience and give cause for optimism. This promise is central to our work in equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI). To bring joy to others, we must first ensure everyone at OB feels valued, included and most importantly, can be themselves at work. 

At company level, we have set out our approach to EDI with our Leadership team, who are committed to leading on all our initiatives and conveying that message across the business. We empower our managers to promote a sense of belonging within their teams. We also expect everyone at OB to value and look out for each other by always being considerate and mindful of others.

We pride ourselves on our unique product range – created by our in-house design team and global brand partnerships, all of which are recognisable by their individuality, design and quality.

OFFICE was first established in 1981 as a concession in the Capital’s department store of choice, ‘Hyper Hyper’. Our name was born from the fact we originally displayed our products on old office furniture; a quirky detail, which is representative of the brand to this day. We proved such a hit with London’s fashion scene that we opened our first stand-alone store on the Kings road in 1984. Since then we have continued to grow and acquire stores in some of the most celebrated shopping destinations across the UK and Germany.

In 1996 OFFICE launched OFFSPRING a pioneering concept set to revolutionize the world of fashion sports retailing. OFFSPRING was the first sneaker store to fill the gap in the market for fashion sportswear, creating trainers with style at the forefront of their design. To this day OFFSPRING provides our customers with exclusive, limited edition styles, devised by collaborations with a multitude of must-have brands. 

OFFICE was acquired by Truworths International an investment holding and Management Company in December 2015. Truworths is a market-leading fashion apparel retailer in South Africa.

The OFFICE Head Office team is based at our East London HQ, where a group of dedicated designers and buyers are consistently presenting pioneering and up-to-the minute trends. Our stores are filled with the best employees on the high street, who deliver passionate, inspiring and individual service to our customers every day.

Developed at the Victoria Beckham atelier in London, today the brand offering includes ready-to-wear, footwear, expertly crafted eyewear, and timeless leather goods.
 
The transition from designer muse to Creative Director of her own brand was a natural one, fuelled by a longtime obsession with design and art, an authentic and meticulous attention to detail, and a distinctly luxurious sensibility that ignites the imagination. 

With influences from the worlds of art and film, the Victoria Beckham brand is defined by a considered blend of classic British luxury with a subtle contemporary flair, resulting in immaculately cut tailoring, dresses, denim, and separates, with signature touches in the form of off-kilter prints, modern cuts and colour palettes.
 
The Victoria Beckham woman is core to the brand’s foundation and visual identity, which is polished, elevated, relevant, and always informed by the current moment. 
 
The Spring Summer 2023 collection marks a new chapter in the brand’s history, driven by a strategic root-and-branch overhaul and a highly acclaimed debut at Paris Fashion Week. An embracing of femininity, an assertion of values, and a celebration of craft, the collection underscores the classic heritage of the brand, with a modern and luxurious look and feel.
 
With offices in London and New York and a flagship store in Mayfair, the brand has won critical acclaim alongside multiple industry awards including Best Designer Brand and Brand of the Year at the BFC’s Fashion Awards. 

In addition to victoriabeckham.com, Victoria Beckham is carried in 230 stores in 50 countries worldwide, with dedicated personalised spaces in key department stores.

Kaitlyn Seigler,Director Of Ecommerce,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlynseigler,,,,,,New York City Metropolitan Area,6/23/2024,IPPOLITA,"        Born and raised in the hills of Florence, Ippolita has always been inspired by the richness and simplicity of Italian culture. As a young girl, she discovered her love for jewelry in the shops and stalls of Ponte Vecchio. An artist first and a designer second, Ippolita studied sculpture and ceramics for five years at the Istituto D’Arte in Florence. After working in bronze and stone on large-scale works, Ippolita was inspired to apply her aesthetic to the world of adornment when she launched her eponymous jewelry collection in 1999 in New York with Bergdorf Goodman. 

A reverence for women and the female body has informed her style and her design vocabulary from the start. Her highly personal approach to fine jewelry is expressed in the sculptural nature of the organic shapes of her precious metals. A proprietary blend of 18K Gold and other precious metals creates a distinctive “green” hue, flattering to all skin types while her 925 Silver is a color with a brilliance all its own. The stone cuts Ippolita uses are characterized by their artfully random, larger-than-normal facets that conspire to create plays of light and shadow against the skin. 

Ippolita’s jewelry is an encounter with beauty. That beauty is an experience shared – between seller and buyer, wearer and creator, lover and loved one, devotee and neophyte. It is generous, participatory, outward-facing, welcoming, and open to all. 

“Beauty in our everyday lives brings joy to the human experience and fosters a culture of care.”

But while our sole technology may be German, our soul is undeniably British. 

British shoe-makers, R Griggs and Co, bought the rights to that air-cushioned sole technology. R Griggs & Co anglicised the name to “Dr. Martens”, designed an outsole and boot for British workers and the 1460 boot was born. 

Dr. Martens footwear was designed to look new with its modern air-cushion comfort so R Griggs & Co added the iconic yellow stitch, the grooves, the two tone side sole and the black and yellow heel loop. These new boots were sold to workmen. 

But fate intervened. Dr. Martens may have been made for industry but, as it turns out, they were destined for the stage. Subverted early on by subcultures, they paved the way for a new kind of rebellious self-expression. From the punks of 70s London to the grungers of 90s Seattle, Dr. Martens boots have always stood with those who dare to be different. Subcultures may fade out and evolve but our alternative spirit is a constant. 

And as for what the future holds? 

We have offices in London, Northampton, Paris, Düsseldorf, Portland, across Asia and an ever-expanding global retail portfolio. We have the respect of big-name fashion giants – think Supreme and Yohji Yamamoto – enabling us to engage in exciting partnerships season after season. 

We want to mean something to everyone who laces up our boots: from the first-timers to the Docs boots veterans.
